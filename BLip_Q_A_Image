Lesson 12: Visual Question & Answering
In the classroom, the libraries are already installed for you.
If you would like to run this code on your own machine, you can install the following:
    !pip install transformers
Here is some code that suppresses warning messages.
from transformers.utils import logging
logging.set_verbosity_error()
â€‹
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore", message="Using the model-agnostic default `max_length`")
Load the Model and the Processor.
from transformers import BlipForQuestionAnswering
model = BlipForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained(
    "./models/Salesforce/blip-vqa-base")
Info about Salesforce/blip-vqa-base

from transformers import AutoProcessor
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(
    "./models/Salesforce/blip-vqa-base")
Load the image.
from PIL import Image
image = Image.open("./beach.jpeg")
image

Write the question you want to ask to the model about the image.
question = "how many dogs are in the picture?"
inputs = processor(image, question, return_tensors="pt")
out = model.generate(**inputs)
print(processor.decode(out[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
